# NeuralNet-MNIST
A neural network in python for MNIST Handwritten digit database.

The Network is based on a basic 3 layer architecture using only the built in functionalities and libraries of python.

The dataset is first converted into csv format before loading in the network. 

Performance Results:
- Total number of correct predictions 9306.0
- Total predictions 10000.0
- performance =  0.9306

Future work 
1. Improve the accuracy.
2. Create a Learning rate vs accuracy graph.
3. Move the functionality to scipy to reduce processing time
